     * The options accepted by the constructor are described in detail
     * in [this document](https://github.com/googleapis/gax-nodejs/blob/master/client-libraries.md#creating-the-client-instance).
     * The common options are:
     * @param {object} [options.credentials] - Credentials object.
     * @param {string} [options.credentials.client_email]
     * @param {string} [options.credentials.private_key]
     * @param {string} [options.email] - Account email address. Required when
     *     using a .pem or .p12 keyFilename.
     * @param {string} [options.keyFilename] - Full path to the a .json, .pem, or
     *     .p12 key downloaded from the Google Developers Console. If you provide
     *     a path to a JSON file, the projectId option below is not necessary.
     *     NOTE: .pem and .p12 require you to specify options.email as well.
     * @param {number} [options.port] - The port on which to connect to
     *     the remote host.
     * @param {string} [options.projectId] - The project ID from the Google
     *     Developer's Console, e.g. 'grape-spaceship-123'. We will also check
     *     the environment variable GCLOUD_PROJECT for your project ID. If your
     *     app is running in an environment which supports
     *     {@link https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials Application Default Credentials},
     *     your project ID will be detected automatically.
     * @param {string} [options.apiEndpoint] - The domain name of the
     *     API remote host.
     * @param {gax.ClientConfig} [options.clientConfig] - Client configuration override.
     *     Follows the structure of {@link gapicConfig}.
     * @param {boolean} [options.fallback] - Use HTTP fallback mode.
     *     In fallback mode, a special browser-compatible transport implementation is used
     *     instead of gRPC transport. In browser context (if the `window` object is defined)
     *     the fallback mode is enabled automatically; set `options.fallback` to `false`
     *     if you need to override this behavior.
